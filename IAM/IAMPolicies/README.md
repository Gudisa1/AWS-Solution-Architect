# IAM Policy for Full S3 Access

This guide explains how to create an IAM policy that grants full access to all S3 buckets and their contents, and how to attach this policy to an IAM user.

## 1. Define the Policy

The policy document grants full access to all S3 buckets and objects. Save the following JSON policy to a file named `policy.json`:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "FullAccessToAllS3Buckets",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:

- **`Action`:** `"s3:*"` grants all S3 actions.
- **`Resource`:** `"*"` applies to all S3 buckets and objects.

## 2. Create the IAM Policy

Use the AWS CLI to create the IAM policy based on the `policy.json` file:

```bash
aws iam create-policy \
    --policy-name S3-FullAccess \
    --policy-document file://policy.json \
    --description "This policy grants full access to all S3 buckets and their contents."
```

### Output:

On success, you will receive a response similar to the following:

```json
{
    "Policy": {
        "PolicyName": "S3-FullAccess",
        "PolicyId": "ANPAQGYBQCHOO3WSWFTQY",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::014498664924:policy/S3-FullAccess",
        "Path": "/",
        "DefaultVersionId": "v1",
        "AttachmentCount": 0,
        "PermissionsBoundaryUsageCount": 0,
        "IsAttachable": true,
        "CreateDate": "2024-09-05T21:18:07Z",
        "UpdateDate": "2024-09-05T21:18:07Z"
    }
}
```

## 3. Attach the Policy to an IAM User

To attach the newly created policy to an IAM user, use the following AWS CLI command. Replace `gudisa` with the username of the IAM user you want to attach the policy to:

```bash
aws iam attach-user-policy \
    --user-name gudisa \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::014498664924:policy/S3-FullAccess
```

## 4. Verify Policy Attachment

To verify that the policy has been successfully attached to the user, run:

```bash
aws iam list-attached-user-policies \
    --user-name gudisa
```

This command will list all policies attached to the specified IAM user.
